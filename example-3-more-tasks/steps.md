* We've got javascript in here now
* What do we want to do with it?
* Let's concatenate it and compress it.
* Introduce gulp-include
* Introduce gulp-uglify
* Introduce gulp-rename
* Run gulp js
* Show how the file has been renamed
* Show how the file has been split up and uglified
* Just include it in your markup and it's good to go!
